# Swire Coca-Cola Predictive Maintenance Project
Capstone Project- Fall 2024
This repository contains the Swire Coca-Cola Predictive Maintenance Project conducted as part of Group 2â€™s efforts to address the operational inefficiencies caused by unplanned downtime.

## Introduction
For Swire Coca-Cola, a global leader in the beverage industry, unplanned machine breakdowns represent a $60 million annual loss. This issue impacts production efficiency, targets, and profitability.

Our project leverages predictive analytics to identify breakdown patterns, forecast failures, and optimize maintenance schedules. This data-driven approach aims to minimize unplanned downtime, reduce costs, and improve overall production efficiency.

## Business Problem
Swire Coca-Cola operates six manufacturing plants, producing 192 million beverages annually. However, unplanned machine breakdowns have reduced production capacity to 94.4%, causing substantial delays and financial losses. This project focuses on predicting time-to-failure and implementing proactive maintenance strategies to resolve these challenges.

## Proposed Solution
To address the business problem, our team developed a solution combining predictive analytics and survival analysis to anticipate equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. Key elements include:
1. Survival Analysis: Using Kaplan-Meier estimates to calculate time-to-failure probabilities and identify critical equipment requiring immediate attention.
2. ElasticNet Regression Model: Predicting downtime durations with high accuracy, enabling data-driven decision-making.
3. Actionable Insights: Recommendations for maintenance prioritization and spare parts management to streamline operations.

## My Contribution to the Project
While this project was a team effort, my specific contributions were instrumental in shaping its direction and outcomes:
1. Conducted individual Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), identifying trends and patterns integrated into the final group analysis.
2. Performed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance the ElasticNet regression model's predictive performance.
3. Added interpretative comments to clarify modeling outputs and their implications for stakeholders.
4. Structured the project files, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding for seamless collaboration and presentation.
5. Bridged the gap between survival analysis and regression modeling to deliver cohesive and actionable insights.

## Business Value of the Solution
Our project delivers tangible business value by enabling Swire Coca-Cola to:
1. Reduce unplanned downtime and associated financial losses.
2. Optimize maintenance schedules to improve production efficiency.
3. Enhance operational resilience through data-driven decision-making.
4. Provide a scalable predictive maintenance framework applicable across all manufacturing plants.

## Difficulties Encountered
1. Data Challenges: Cleaning and preprocessing large datasets, addressing missing values, and handling outliers.
2. Model Optimization: Striking the right balance between bias and variance for robust predictions.
3. Integration: Aligning survival analysis with regression models to produce a unified solution.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of:
1. Applying survival analysis and advanced regression techniques to solve real-world business problems.
2. The importance of clear communication and documentation in collaborative projects.
3. How predictive analytics can transform operational efficiency in the manufacturing industry.

## Future Work
Building on this foundation, future enhancements could include:
1. Real-time data collection using IoT sensors for predictive maintenance.
2. Automation of maintenance workflows to further reduce downtime.
3. Expanding the analysis to include planned maintenance activities for a comprehensive strategy.
