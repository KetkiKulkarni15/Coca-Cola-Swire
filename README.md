## Swire Coca-Cola Predictive Maintenance Project
Capstone Project- Fall 2024
I am currently working on the Coca-Cola Swire Predictive Maintenance Project, focusing on optimizing maintenance operations and minimizing equipment downtime at their manufacturing facilities. I am analyzing machine performance data to identify trends and patterns that are helping predict equipment failures before they occur. By using predictive analytics, I am helping the company develop more efficient maintenance schedules, which are improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and preventing production interruptions.

## Business Problem:
Swire Coca-Cola produces 192 million beverages annually across six plants, but unplanned machine breakdowns have reduced production capacity to 94.4%, resulting in a $60 million annual loss. These unpredictable failures cause frequent downtime, affecting output and delaying production.

## Proposed Solution:
Our team is implementing a predictive maintenance system to forecast equipment failures. This will enable engineers to take proactive measures, reducing downtime, optimizing equipment usage, and improving production capacity. The solution will help mitigate the $60 million annual loss and provide insights into high-risk equipment lines.

## Success Metrics:
1. Increase production capacity to 100%.
2. Reduce downtime frequency and duration.
3. Optimize inventory management for faster repairs.
4. Track production output improvements.

## Analytics Approach:
We use a supervised learning approach with a regression model to estimate downtime durations and predict the impact on production. The key variable is "Downtime Duration," and production efficiency is benchmarked at 1000 cases per hour. This model helps in optimizing maintenance schedules and resource allocation by accurately estimating how long a machine will be out of operation when a failure occurs.

## Scope:
 In Scope: Predictive models, equipment performance dashboard, and optimized spare parts inventory.

## Out of Scope: Analysis of planned maintenance and direct financial savings.

## Future Additions: Real-time tracking and sensors for accurate failure detection.

## Team Members: Richard Lim, Ketki Kulkarni, Anusha Vivekanand, Vedika Garg.
