# Swire Coca-Cola Predictive Maintenance Project - Individual Contribution

## Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective
Swire Coca-Cola faces a significant challenge due to unplanned machine breakdowns, leading to an estimated $60 million in annual losses. The project aimed to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules using survival analysis and regression modeling techniques. This proactive approach helps minimize downtime, reduce costs, and improve operational efficiency.

## Group's Solution to the Business Problem
Our group utilized survival analysis and regression modeling to address the issue of unplanned downtime. By analyzing machine performance data, we identified failure patterns and predicted time-to-failure for critical equipment. These insights enabled Swire Coca-Cola to schedule maintenance proactively, reducing operational disruptions and financial losses.

Key Insights from Survival Analysis:
- Roma (G812): Equipment fails, on average, within 0.47 days.
- Cota (G816): Average failure time is 0.65 days.
- Suzuka (G221): Equipment tends to fail after 1.24 days.

Model Performance Highlights:
- ElasticNet Regression: Test RMSE: 82.27, Test MSE: 6767.92

## My Contribution to the Project
- Conducted individual exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insights that were integrated into the final group submission.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance and ensure generalizability.
- Added detailed interpretative comments to the notebook to clearly explain results and their implications.
- Structured and organized the file to ensure readability and ease of understanding for team members and stakeholders.

## Business Value of the Solution
The project provided Swire Coca-Cola with actionable insights to minimize unplanned downtime, streamline operations, and reduce financial losses. Predictive maintenance scheduling empowered the company to enhance production capacity and allocate resources efficiently.

## Difficulties Encountered
The team faced challenges in cleaning and preprocessing the data due to missing values and outliers. Integrating diverse insights from multiple group members and achieving optimal model performance through hyperparameter tuning required significant coordination and effort.

## What I Learned from the Project
This project deepened my understanding of predictive analytics, survival analysis, and regression modeling. I gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning while working collaboratively with my team to deliver actionable insights for a real-world business problem.
